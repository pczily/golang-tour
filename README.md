# exercise-slices.go
Exercise: Slices
Implement Pic. It should return a slice of length dy, each element of which is a slice of dx 8-bit unsigned integers. When you run the program, it will display your picture, interpreting the integers as grayscale (well, bluescale) values.

The choice of image is up to you. Interesting functions include (x+y)/2, x*y, and x^y.

(You need to use a loop to allocate each []uint8 inside the [][]uint8.)

(Use uint8(intValue) to convert between types.)

# exercise-maps.go
Exercise: Maps
Implement WordCount. It should return a map of the counts of each “word” in the string s. The wc.Test function runs a test suite against the provided function and prints success or failure.

You might find strings.Fields helpful.

# exercise-fibonacci-closre.go
Exercise: Fibonacci closure
Let's have some fun with functions.

Implement a fibonacci function that returns a function (a closure) that returns successive fibonacci numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...).

# exercise-stringer.go
Exercise: Stringers
Make the IPAddr type implement fmt.Stringer to print the address as a dotted quad.

For instance, IPAddr{1, 2, 3, 4} should print as "1.2.3.4".
